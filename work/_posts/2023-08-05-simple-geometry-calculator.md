This is just a simple app to to calculate the volume and area of ​​a geometry. For now, the geometries are just right circular cone, sphere, right circular cylinder, cube, and rectangular solid. I hope i can add more geometries soon.

This app is simply created with vanilla JavaScript, and HTML CSS of course.
