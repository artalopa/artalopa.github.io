This is a responsive portfolio landing page built with Tailwind CSS. The design is inspired from one of many excellent designs on dribbble.com

I downloaded the image file, then i started to convert it into a web page. I realized that building a web page without proper assets is a little bit harder than i thought. Some assets that i search from the interternet sometimes doesn't match with the design.
